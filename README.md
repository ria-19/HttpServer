## Lightweight, Testable HTTP Server in Java (LLD Focus)

## Purpose:

This project implements a basic HTTP server in Java for learning experience in low-level design (LLD) concepts. It's designed for:

* **Understanding LLD:** Gain practical experience with threading, sockets, and other core LLD principles.
* **Testable Code:** Write robust and verifiable code using a custom or lightweight testing framework.
* **Configuration Management:** Effectively manage configuration data using the Singleton pattern.
* **Data Binding:** Utilize Jackson for convenient mapping between POJOs and configuration files.
* **Scalability Potential:** Explore code structure considerations for future scalability improvements.

## Technologies and Tools:

* **Languages:** Java
* **Build Tool (Optional):** Maven
* **Concurrency:** Multithreading
* **Networking:** Sockets
* **Testing Framework:** Custom or Lightweight Alternative (e.g., JUnit)
* **Data Binding:** Jackson
* **Logging (Optional):** SLF4J, Logback (dependencies included)
* **Development Environment (IDE):** Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Description:

This project focuses on hands-on exploration of LLD principles while building a functional HTTP server. It offers a structured environment for learning about:

* Threading mechanisms for handling concurrent client connections.
* Low-level network communication using sockets.
* Importance of writing testable code for verification and reliability.
* Utilizing the Singleton pattern for managing configuration data.
* Leveraging Jackson for seamless POJO-to-JSON data binding.

While initial performance may not be optimized, the code is structured with considerations for potential scalability improvements in the future.

This project serves as a valuable starting point for those interested in exploring LLD concepts and building their understanding of HTTP servers.
